			The project started so undocumented immigrants can tap in an instant solidarity network to support them during a deportation raid
			</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>
			I am currently volunteering as a UX designer with the New Sanctuary Coalition to design a rapid response notification system for undocumented immigrants facing an immediate deportation raid. People need help from their immediate contacts and a wider community activist network, but they have no time. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The project started in response to the current social and political climate, where the New Sanctuary Coalition sought collaborators to create a (digital and non-digital) system that will help those detained to communicate with their support network as quick as possible.

		I designed this wireframe of an alert app to connect detainees to their network quickly in case of an emergency. I have interviewed clients, carried out workshops, created user flows and wireframes, and will soon user test the initial prototype. I created a user flow diagram to describe how people helped detainees travelling into JFK airport.
